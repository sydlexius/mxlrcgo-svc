// Package detector provides an optional audio-based instrumental detection
// sidecar. It sends short audio windows to an external AudioSet classifier
// (e.g. YAMNet/PANNs served over FastAPI) and aggregates per-class
// probabilities to determine whether a track is instrumental.
//
// The sidecar pattern mirrors internal/verification: a Go HTTP client drives
// an out-of-process ML model; the heavy inference never enters the no-CGO Go
// binary. All detector errors are non-fatal: callers log a warning and fall
// through to miss handling. Detector starvation (slow or unavailable sidecar)
// is acceptable; host CPU starvation is not. The HTTPDetector serializes
// inference calls and enforces a per-call cooldown to prevent runaway resource
// use.
