# Configuration

Every setting can come from a TOML config file or be overridden by an environment variable (and a few by a CLI flag). This page documents the precedence, the complete environment-variable surface, the TOML config keys, and the default storage paths.

A fully commented `config.example.toml` ships in the repository root; copy it and edit the keys you need. The sections below cross-reference it.

## Token precedence

A Musixmatch API token is required. Supply it using any of the following methods, listed in order of precedence (highest first):

1. **`--token` CLI flag** - highest priority.
   ```sh
   mxlrcgo-svc --token YOUR_TOKEN adele,hello
   ```
2. **`MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN` environment variable** (`MXLRC_API_TOKEN` is accepted as a lower-precedence alias).
   ```sh
   export MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
   mxlrcgo-svc adele,hello
   ```
3. **Config file / `.env` file** - place a `.env` in the working directory where you run the command, or set the token in the TOML config.
   ```sh
   MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

To obtain a token, follow steps 1 to 5 from the [Spicetify guide](https://spicetify.app/docs/faq#sometimes-popup-lyrics-andor-lyrics-plus-seem-to-not-work).

## General precedence

For all settings, precedence is **CLI flag > environment variable > config file > built-in default**.

## Storage paths

`mxlrcgo-svc` resolves its config file and SQLite database using XDG base directories by default, with overrides for Docker and native packages.

| Install method | Config file | Database |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| XDG (default) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mxlrcgo-svc/config.toml` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mxlrcgo-svc/mxlrcgo.db` |
| Docker (`MXLRC_DOCKER=true`) | `/config/config.toml` | `/config/mxlrcgo.db` |
| Native package (`.deb`/`.rpm`/`.apk`) | `/etc/mxlrcgo-svc/config.toml` | `/var/lib/mxlrcgo-svc/mxlrcgo.db` |

Native packages run the service as the `mxlrcgo-svc` system user; that user owns `/var/lib/mxlrcgo-svc` (mode `0750`). The state directory and system user are preserved on package removal so the database survives an upgrade or reinstall.

Override any path explicitly with `MXLRC_DB_PATH`, `MXLRC_OUTPUT_DIR`, or the `--config` flag.

### Instrumental tracks and `--upgrade`

Instrumental tracks always write a `.txt` marker file. These files are intentionally excluded from `--upgrade` promotion: re-fetching an instrumental would simply produce the same marker. Use `--update` (full re-fetch) if you want to force a re-check of an instrumental marker after a catalog change.

## Environment variables

The table below is the complete env-var surface; the watcher and verification sections of the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md) give the operational detail.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN` | (required) | Musixmatch API token. `MXLRC_API_TOKEN` is accepted as a lower-precedence alias. |
| `MXLRC_WEBHOOK_API_KEY` | (none) | Comma-separated webhook API key(s) accepted by the server. Generate with `mxlrcgo-svc keys create --scope webhook`. |
| `MXLRC_SERVER_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:3876` | HTTP listen address for `serve`. Docker images default this to `0.0.0.0:50705`. |
| `MXLRC_OUTPUT_DIR` | XDG / `/music` | Fallback output directory for webhook jobs that resolve via metadata. |
| `MXLRC_DB_PATH` | XDG / `/config/mxlrcgo.db` | SQLite database path. |
| `MXLRC_DOCKER` | `false` | When `true`, storage defaults resolve under `/config`. Set automatically in the images. |
| `MXLRC_API_COOLDOWN` | `15` | Seconds between Musixmatch requests. `MXLRC_COOLDOWN` is a lower-precedence alias. |
| `MXLRC_API_CIRCUIT_OPEN_DURATION` | `1800` | Cap (seconds) for the worker circuit-breaker window; the window ramps geometrically up to this ceiling, and a token-renewal signal opens for the full cap (floor 300). |
| `MXLRC_API_CIRCUIT_BACKOFF_BASE` | `60` | Trip-1 circuit-breaker window (seconds); doubles each consecutive throttle up to `MXLRC_API_CIRCUIT_OPEN_DURATION`, resets on a successful fetch or clean miss (floor 15, capped at the open-duration). |
| `MXLRC_SCAN_INTERVAL` | `900` | `serve` library-scan interval in seconds. `0` scans once without repeating. |
| `MXLRC_WORK_INTERVAL` | `0` | Worker poll interval in seconds. `0` falls back to `api.cooldown` (15s floor). |
| `MXLRC_PROVIDER_PRIMARY` | `musixmatch` | Primary lyrics provider. |
| `MXLRC_PROVIDERS_DISABLED` | (none) | Comma-separated providers to disable. |
| `MXLRC_GUARD_ACCEPTED_SCRIPTS` | (none) | Comma-separated allowlist of Unicode script buckets a lyric body may use (Latin, Han, Kana, Hangul, Other). Empty disables the language/script guard. |
| `MXLRC_GUARD_THRESHOLD` | `0.20` | Maximum tolerated share of foreign-script letters before a result is rejected. Values outside (0, 1] reset to the default. |
| `MXLRC_QUEUE_RANDOMIZE` | `true` | Shuffle worker dequeue order within each priority tier (anti-fingerprint). `false` restores deterministic order. |
| `MXLRC_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Minimum log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. `debug` exposes per-request detail, worker idle-polls, and watcher events. |
| `MXLRC_LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | Log output format: `text` (human-readable) or `json` (structured, for log aggregators). |
| `MXLRC_LOG_FILE` | (none) | Log file path. Empty means console-only (stderr). When set, logs go to both stderr and the file with automatic rotation. |
| `MXLRC_LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB` | `10` | Maximum log file size in megabytes before rotation. |
| `MXLRC_LOG_MAX_FILES` | `5` | Number of rotated log files to retain. |
| `MXLRC_LOG_MAX_AGE_DAYS` | `30` | Maximum age in days of retained rotated log files. |
| `MXLRC_LOG_COMPRESS` | `true` | Compress rotated log files with gzip. |
| `MXLRCGO_WATCH_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the optional low-latency filesystem watcher (see the User Guide). |
| `MXLRCGO_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS` | `2000` | Watcher debounce window in milliseconds. |
| `MXLRCGO_WATCH_MAX_DIRS` | `100000` | Watcher safety cap on directories watched. |
| `MXLRC_VERIFICATION_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Whisper-based lyric verification (requires a sidecar and `ffmpeg`). |
| `MXLRC_VERIFICATION_WHISPER_URL` | (none) | Whisper-compatible transcription endpoint. `MXLRC_WHISPER_URL` is an alias. |
| `MXLRC_VERIFICATION_FFMPEG_PATH` | `ffmpeg` | Path to the `ffmpeg` binary used to extract audio samples. |
| `MXLRC_VERIFICATION_SAMPLE_DURATION_SECONDS` | `30` | Audio sample length sent to Whisper. `MXLRC_VERIFICATION_SAMPLE_DURATION` is an alias. |
| `MXLRC_VERIFICATION_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | `0.85` | Below this Musixmatch confidence, verify against Whisper (0-1). |
| `MXLRC_VERIFICATION_MIN_SIMILARITY` | `0.35` | Minimum transcript/lyric overlap to accept (0-1). |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | `99` / `100` | Container-only: user/group the process drops to for file ownership. |

## TOML config keys

The TOML config file mirrors the environment variables in named sections. The keys below correspond one-to-one with `config.example.toml`, which carries inline documentation for each.

### `[api]`

```toml
[api]
cooldown = 15
circuit_open_duration = 1800
# circuit_backoff_base = 60
```

Request cooldown and the worker circuit-breaker window (env: `MXLRC_API_COOLDOWN`, `MXLRC_API_CIRCUIT_OPEN_DURATION`, `MXLRC_API_CIRCUIT_BACKOFF_BASE`).

### `[output]`

```toml
[output]
dir = "lyrics"
```

Fallback output directory for webhook jobs that resolve via metadata (env: `MXLRC_OUTPUT_DIR`).

### `[db]`

```toml
[db]
# path = "mxlrcgo.db"
```

SQLite database path (env: `MXLRC_DB_PATH`).

### `[server]`

```toml
[server]
addr = "127.0.0.1:3876"
# webhook_api_keys = ["mxlrc_your-webhook-key"]
# scan_interval_seconds = 900
# work_interval_seconds = 0
```

HTTP listen address, webhook keys, and the scheduler scan/worker poll intervals (env: `MXLRC_SERVER_ADDR`, `MXLRC_WEBHOOK_API_KEY`, `MXLRC_SCAN_INTERVAL`, `MXLRC_WORK_INTERVAL`; CLI: `--listen`, `--scan-interval`, `--work-interval`).

### `[providers]`

```toml
[providers]
primary = "musixmatch"
disabled = []
```

Provider selection. Musixmatch is the default provider; the config exposes selection so future providers can be added without changing the fetch and worker paths (env: `MXLRC_PROVIDER_PRIMARY`, `MXLRC_PROVIDERS_DISABLED`).

### `[verification]`

```toml
[verification]
enabled = false
whisper_url = ""
ffmpeg_path = "ffmpeg"
sample_duration_seconds = 30
min_confidence = 0.85
min_similarity = 0.35
```

Optional Whisper-based speech-to-text verification for low-confidence scanned audio. When enabled, `ffmpeg` must be installed or `ffmpeg_path` must point to an executable ffmpeg binary. The worker extracts a bounded mono 16 kHz WAV sample using `sample_duration_seconds`, then sends it to a Whisper-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` sidecar for audio whose Musixmatch metadata confidence is below `min_confidence`. The transcript must overlap the candidate lyrics by at least `min_similarity`. Environment variables override the TOML keys (`MXLRC_VERIFICATION_*`); `MXLRC_WHISPER_URL` and `MXLRC_VERIFICATION_SAMPLE_DURATION` remain accepted as legacy aliases.

### `[guard]`

```toml
[guard]
accepted_scripts = []
script_guard_threshold = 0.20
```

Optional language/script guard. It rejects fetched lyrics whose body is dominated by scripts outside the allowlist, so a wrong-language match (for example a Cyrillic or CJK body returned for a Latin-script track) is never written or cached. An empty `accepted_scripts` list (the default) disables the guard. Supported buckets: Latin, Han, Kana, Hangul, Other (env: `MXLRC_GUARD_ACCEPTED_SCRIPTS`, `MXLRC_GUARD_THRESHOLD`).

### `[queue]`

```toml
[queue]
randomize = true
```

The worker shuffles its dequeue order within each priority tier so it stops querying the upstream API in strict alphabetical (library insertion) order, which is a plausible scraping fingerprint. This is **on by default** and affects only the library/serve worker path (`Dequeue`); inspection output (`queue list`) stays deterministic, and the one-shot `fetch` CLI never touches the work queue. Set `randomize = false` (or `MXLRC_QUEUE_RANDOMIZE=false`) to restore the deterministic `created_at`/`id` ordering. The env var overrides the TOML key; an invalid value warns and keeps the current setting.

### `[logging]`

```toml
[logging]
level = "info"
format = "text"
# file = ""
# max_size_mb = 10
# max_files = 5
# max_age_days = 30
# compress = true
```

Log level, format, and the rotating file-log settings (env: `MXLRC_LOG_LEVEL`, `MXLRC_LOG_FORMAT`, `MXLRC_LOG_FILE`, `MXLRC_LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB`, `MXLRC_LOG_MAX_FILES`, `MXLRC_LOG_MAX_AGE_DAYS`, `MXLRC_LOG_COMPRESS`).
