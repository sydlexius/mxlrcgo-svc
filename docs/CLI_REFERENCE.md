# CLI Reference

This page documents every subcommand and flag. For operational guidance (running the server, Docker/Unraid, the watcher), see the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md). For every setting, see [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md).

## Usage

```text
Usage: canticle [fetch|serve|scan|library|keys|secrets|config|queue|provenance|completion]

Commands:
  fetch       fetch lyrics once without HTTP server or DB queue
  serve       run HTTP server, worker, and library scheduler
  scan        scan configured libraries and enqueue missing lyrics
  library     manage library roots
  keys        manage API keys

Global flags:
  --version  print the build version and exit
  --help     show help for the program or a subcommand

Legacy flag-only invocation is still supported:
  canticle [--outdir OUTDIR] [--cooldown COOLDOWN] [--depth DEPTH] [--update] [--upgrade] [--bfs] [--serve] [--listen LISTEN] [--token TOKEN] [--config CONFIG] [SONG ...]
```

## Version

`canticle --version` prints the embedded build metadata, for example
`canticle v1.1.0 (commit 1a2b3c4, built 2026-06-05T00:00:00Z)`. Release
binaries and the published Docker images carry the real tag; a `go build` or
`go install` from source reports `dev` unless you inject the ldflags yourself.

## Fetch

One-shot lyric fetching without the HTTP server or DB queue.

### One song

```sh
canticle adele,hello
canticle fetch adele,hello
```

### Multiple songs and a custom output directory

```sh
canticle adele,hello "the killers,mr. brightside" -o some_directory
```

### With a text file and a custom cooldown time

```sh
canticle example_input.txt -c 20
```

### Directory mode (recursive)

```sh
canticle "Dream Theater"
```

> **_This option overrides the `-o/--outdir` argument which means the lyrics will be saved in the same directory as the given input._**
>
> **_The output extension depends on the lyric type: `.lrc` when synced lyrics are found, and `.txt` when only unsynced lyrics or an instrumental marker is written._**
>
> **_The `-d/--depth` argument limits the depth of subdirectories to scan; use `-d 0` or `--depth 0` to only scan the specified directory._**

The `--upgrade` flag re-fetches tracks that previously produced a `.txt` (unsynced) file, to promote them to `.lrc` when synced lyrics later become available. Instrumental tracks are always written as `.txt` and are excluded from upgrade - only `--update` (full re-fetch) overrides them.

In directory mode, when audio tags carry ISRC, MusicBrainz recording ID, or duration, those values are read and passed to Musixmatch to improve match precision - for example, distinguishing two recordings of the same title.

## Serve

Run the HTTP server, worker, and library scheduler. See the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md#lidarr-webhook-server) for full operational detail.

```sh
canticle serve --listen 127.0.0.1:3876
canticle serve --config path/to/config.toml
```

Relevant serve flags: `--listen` (overrides `MXLRC_SERVER_ADDR`), `--scan-interval`, `--work-interval`, and `--config`.

## Library and key management

```sh
canticle library add /data/media/music --name Music
canticle library list
canticle scan
canticle keys create --name lidarr --scope webhook
canticle keys list
canticle keys revoke <raw-api-key>
```

`keys` has three subcommands: `create` (`--name`, repeatable `--scope` of `webhook` or `admin`; prints the raw key once), `list` (tab-separated public ID, name, scopes, revoked-at), and `revoke <raw-api-key>`. All accept `--config`. See [Webhook API keys](USER_GUIDE.md#webhook-api-keys) for the full workflow and the web UI equivalent.

## Secrets

The Musixmatch token and the webhook API key can be stored encrypted at rest in the database instead of as plaintext in `config.toml` or environment variables. The encrypted store is the lowest-precedence source, so CLI flags, env vars, and TOML still win over it.

```sh
# Encrypt the currently-effective secret(s) into the DB store.
canticle secrets import                 # both token and webhook key
canticle secrets import --token         # only the Musixmatch token
canticle secrets import --webhook       # only the webhook API key

# Set one secret by name. The value is read from stdin (prompt or pipe),
# never from argv. Valid names: musixmatch_token, webhook_api_key.
canticle secrets set musixmatch_token             # prompts for the value
printf '%s' "$TOKEN" | canticle secrets set musixmatch_token

# List stored secret names and their updated_at (never the values).
canticle secrets list
```

`secrets set` rejects a value passed on the command line (it would land in shell history and `ps`); supply it on stdin. All three subcommands accept `--config`. See [Encrypted secrets](USER_GUIDE.md#encrypted-secrets) for the precedence model and key-loss recovery.

## Config

Inspect or update the configuration file from the CLI.

```sh
canticle config get db.path        # print one value by dotted key
canticle config set api.cooldown 30   # update one key, then write the config file
canticle config list               # print every known key as key=value
```

`config` has three subcommands: `get <key>` (prints the single value, exit 2 on an unknown key), `set <key> <value>` (applies the change to the effective config and writes the whole file back, creating it at the default path if absent), and `list` (prints every known key as `key=value`). All accept `--config` to target a non-default config file.

## Queue and scan inspection

The `queue` and `scan` subcommands expose the durable work queue and persisted scan results. See [Inspection commands](USER_GUIDE.md#inspection-commands) in the User Guide for the full command set (`queue list`/`failed`/`deferred`/`retry`/`clear`, and `scan results`/`clear`).

## Provenance

Synced `.lrc` files written by `canticle` carry provenance tags in the header block that identify where and when each file came from. These tags appear after the standard metadata tags (`[by:]`, `[ar:]`, `[ti:]`, etc.) and before the first timestamped lyric line:

```text
[source:musixmatch]
[fetched:2026-06-15T12:00:00Z]
[ve:v1.2.0]
[isrc:USRC17607834]
[mbid:9f2a2b4c-1234-5678-abcd-000000000000]
```

| Tag | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[source:]` | provider lane name | e.g. `musixmatch`, `petitlyrics` |
| `[fetched:]` | ISO 8601 fetch timestamp | UTC; absent on cache hits |
| `[ve:]` | generating canticle version | e.g. `v1.2.0`; `dev` on local builds |
| `[isrc:]` | ISRC recording identifier | when available from the audio file or API response |
| `[mbid:]` | MusicBrainz recording ID | when available from the audio file |

### Provenance backfill

Existing `.lrc` files that predate this feature can have provenance tags injected retroactively from the work queue database:

```sh
# Preview what would change (dry run)
canticle provenance backfill

# Target specific paths or directories
canticle provenance backfill /data/music/Artist

# Apply the changes
canticle provenance backfill --yes

# Apply to specific paths
canticle provenance backfill --yes /data/music/Artist/Album
```

The backfill is idempotent: tags that already exist in a file are skipped; only genuinely absent tags are injected. The `[ve:]` tag is never injected on backfill (the originating version is not recorded in the database). Files for which the database has no matching row, or with only partial metadata, are reported as `partial` rather than `seeded`.

**Cache-hit writes and missing `[source:]`/`[fetched:]` tags:** when a lyric fetch is served from the in-memory cache, `[ve:]` is written inline but `[source:]` and `[fetched:]` are absent because those fields are transient (not persisted alongside the cached result). Run `provenance backfill --yes` after a cache-hit write to pull the source lane and fetch timestamp from the work queue database and inject them retroactively.

## Shell completion

```sh
canticle completion <bash|zsh|fish>
```

See [Shell completion](USER_GUIDE.md#shell-completion) for installation snippets.
