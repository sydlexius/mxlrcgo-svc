# install-tailwind.sh -- download + verify the Tailwind v4 standalone CLI.
#
# The serve-mode web UI's CSS is generated at build time (issue #364), so every
# build path that runs `make ui` / `make tailwind` needs the node-free Tailwind
# standalone binary on disk. This script downloads it from the GitHub release and
# validates its sha256 against the release's sha256sums.txt before installing, so
# a tampered or truncated download fails loudly instead of producing bad CSS.
#
# Reused by the Dockerfile, GoReleaser before-hooks, and CI so the download +
# checksum logic lives in exactly one place.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/install-tailwind.sh [DEST]
#
#   DEST       install path for the binary (default: ./tailwindcss in CWD).
#              May also be set via the TAILWIND_DEST env var; the positional
#              arg wins when both are given.
#
# Env overrides:
#   TAILWIND_VERSION  release tag without the leading v (default: 4.2.0)
#   TAILWIND_ASSET    release asset name; when unset it is auto-detected from
#                     uname (e.g. tailwindcss-linux-x64, tailwindcss-macos-arm64).
#                     Override for musl libc (Alpine): tailwindcss-linux-x64-musl.
#
# Exit status: 0 on success; non-zero on download or checksum failure.
