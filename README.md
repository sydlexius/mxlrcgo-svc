Command line tool and webhook service to fetch synced lyrics from [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/) and save them as `.lrc` files.

## Install

**macOS / Linuxbrew (Homebrew):**

```sh
brew install sydlexius/tap/mxlrcgo-svc
```

**Linux (.deb / .rpm / .apk):** Download the appropriate package for your distro
from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sydlexius/mxlrcgo-svc/releases)
page and install it with your package manager:

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i mxlrcgo-svc_*.deb

# RHEL / Fedora / Rocky
sudo rpm -i mxlrcgo-svc_*.rpm

# Alpine
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted mxlrcgo-svc_*.apk
```

The package installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin/mxlrcgo-svc`, a systemd unit
(or OpenRC script on Alpine), and an example config at
`/etc/mxlrcgo-svc/config.example.toml`. It also creates a `mxlrcgo-svc`
system user and a state directory at `/var/lib/mxlrcgo-svc` (mode `0750`) that
holds the SQLite database. The service does **not** start automatically on
install.

After installing, copy the example config, set your token, and start the service:

```sh
sudo cp /etc/mxlrcgo-svc/config.example.toml /etc/mxlrcgo-svc/config.toml
# edit /etc/mxlrcgo-svc/config.toml and set [api] token = "YOUR_TOKEN"
sudo systemctl enable --now mxlrcgo-svc   # systemd
# or: sudo rc-update add mxlrcgo-svc default && sudo rc-service mxlrcgo-svc start  # Alpine OpenRC
```

The state directory and system user are preserved on package removal so the
database survives upgrades and reinstalls. See the
[User Guide](https://sydlexius.github.io/mxlrcgo-svc/USER_GUIDE/#native-packages)
for service commands, log access, and data paths.

**Tarballs / macOS / Windows:** Versioned archives for all platforms are also
available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sydlexius/mxlrcgo-svc/releases)
page.

**Build from source** (requires Go 1.26.4+):

```sh
go install github.com/sydlexius/mxlrcgo-svc/cmd/mxlrcgo-svc@latest
```

> This fork starts its release line at `v1.0.0`. The upstream `fashni/mxlrc-go` repository does not publish semver release tags, so `v1.0.0` is reserved as the first `mxlrcgo-svc` version.

## Quickstart

```sh
# One song
mxlrcgo-svc adele,hello

# Multiple songs into a custom output directory
mxlrcgo-svc adele,hello "the killers,mr. brightside" -o some_directory

# Directory mode (recursive): writes each lyric file next to its audio file
mxlrcgo-svc "Dream Theater"

# Lidarr webhook server
MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN MXLRC_WEBHOOK_API_KEY=mxlrc_your_webhook_key \
  mxlrcgo-svc serve --listen 127.0.0.1:3876
```

Directory mode overrides `-o/--outdir`; the output extension is `.lrc` for synced lyrics and `.txt` for unsynced lyrics or an instrumental marker. See the [CLI Reference](https://sydlexius.github.io/mxlrcgo-svc/CLI_REFERENCE/) for every flag and the [User Guide](https://sydlexius.github.io/mxlrcgo-svc/USER_GUIDE/) for Docker, Unraid, and webhook deployment.

## Token

A Musixmatch API token is required. Supply it via the `--token` CLI flag, the `MUSIXMATCH_TOKEN` environment variable, or a `.env`/config file, in that order of precedence (CLI > env > file). To get a token, follow steps 1 to 5 from the [Spicetify guide](https://spicetify.app/docs/faq#sometimes-popup-lyrics-andor-lyrics-plus-seem-to-not-work). See [Configuration](https://sydlexius.github.io/mxlrcgo-svc/CONFIGURATION/) for the full env-var and TOML surface.

## Encrypted secrets

The Musixmatch token and the webhook API key can be stored encrypted at rest in the SQLite database (AES-256-GCM) instead of as plaintext in config and environment variables. It is opt-in and backward compatible: the encrypted store is the lowest-precedence source, so existing env/TOML setups are unchanged. Import the current plaintext with `mxlrcgo-svc secrets import`, set one by name from stdin with `mxlrcgo-svc secrets set <name>`, and list stored names (never values) with `mxlrcgo-svc secrets list`. The 32-byte master key is auto-generated as a `0600` key file on first use (the universal zero-setup default on all platforms including Docker). Set `MXLRC_MASTER_KEY` to an optional base64-encoded override for key/data separation (recommended when the threat model includes whole-volume theft). Losing the key makes the encrypted secrets unrecoverable by design; the remedy is to re-import or re-set them with the original plaintext. See the [Encrypted secrets guide](https://sydlexius.github.io/mxlrcgo-svc/USER_GUIDE/#encrypted-secrets).

## Web UI access (serve mode)

The serve-mode browser UI is gated by a single admin account (session login, separate from the webhook API key). It is off by default; enable it with `web_ui_enabled = true` under `[server]`.

First run is interactive. With no admin yet, every UI page redirects to `/setup`, an onboarding form that creates the admin account and (optionally) stores the Musixmatch token and webhook API key encrypted at rest. `/setup` is reachable only from loopback or a configured trusted network (`[server.trusted_networks].cidrs`), so a stranger on the network cannot claim the admin account. After the admin exists, `/setup` is closed.

For headless deployments (Docker), you can skip the interactive form by setting both `MXLRC_WEBAUTH_ADMIN_USER` and `MXLRC_WEBAUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the environment. On startup, if no admin exists yet, the daemon creates one from these values (password must be at least 8 characters). It is idempotent (an existing admin is never overwritten) and the password is never logged. Treat these as bootstrap-only credentials: after first run, sign in and rotate the password, then remove the variables from the environment.
