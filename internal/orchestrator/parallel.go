//   - The first SUITABLE synced result wins immediately and cancels the rest.
//   - The first SUITABLE unsynced result is held and a bounded upgrade window is

//     result arriving within the window preempts it; the window elapsing, or every
//     remaining lane reporting, commits the held unsynced result.
//   - Non-suitable results and errors fall through to the same resolution as ordered
//     mode (best-available > highest-precedence error > unavailable sentinel).
//
// Cancellation/leak contract: a child context is canceled on every return path via
// defer; the results channel is buffered to the launched-goroutine count so a losing
// lane's send never blocks after cancel; the collector discards canceled-lane
// results and does not wait for losers to drain.
